    <h3><b><u>Who Am I?</u></b></h3>
    <p><i>My name is Destiny Gibson. I am a high school student, and I am from New<br>Providence, an island in The Bahamas. My favorite color is pink. My favorite<br> animal is the Australian Emu. I don't have any pets of my own, but I love<br>taking care of them. In my spare time, I like to:</i></p>

  <li>Volunteer (mainly at the different national parks and animal reserves)</li>
  <li>Practice coding/programming</li>
  <li>Listen to music</li>
  <li>Sing</li>
  <li>Practice other languages (mostly Spanish and French)</li>
  <li>Cook</li>
  <li>Draw</li>

        <h3><b><u>What Problem Am I Trying To Solve?</u></b></h3>
        <p><i>As a resident in The Bahamas, and as someone who grew up in New Providence<br>(Nassau), I have noticed a significant amount of animals roaming the streets<br>(mainly cats and dogs). These animals pose a threat, not only to people who reside<br>in the Bahams, but also to themselves. Homeless animals in The Bahamas are<br>considered to be 'feral' or 'wild'. They often attack and chase people (or each other)<br>since there is no leash stopping them. Even animals that are on a leash find a way<br>to injure/hurt innocent bystanders. According to statistics, forty-five percent of<br>tourists report seeing roaming dogs, and two percent state they were "scared" by<br>their presence. This problem became worse when the total number of stray animals<br>in The Bahamas increased in 2019 after
          <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/bahamas/facts-hurricane-dorian-s-devastating-effect-bahamas" target="_blank">Hurricane Dorian </a> destroyed many homes<br>in Grand Bahama and Abaco.</i></p>

<h3><b><u>How Do I Plan To Solve This Problem?</u></b></h3>
<p><i>To help local organizations, such as <a href="https://bnt.bs/" target="_blank">The Bahamas National Trust </a>and<br><a href="https://www.bahamashumane.org/" target="_blank">The Bahamas Humane Society </a>with controlling the stray, endangered<br>and threatened animal populations in The Bahamas, I decided to open<br>an animal shelter, to take care of stray animals, a pet store, to sell pet<br>food, toys, clothes, etc., and a pet adoption centre, to find a new home<br>for the stray animals.</i></p>

<h3><b><u>Where Will the Proceeds Go?</u></b></h3>
<ol>
  <li>Back to the Cause</li>
  <p><i>The aim of D's Anaimal Shelter is to make the islands of The Bahamas<br>a safer place, for those who reside there, by getting homeless animals<br>off the streets and finding them a proper home. So, the first portion of<br>the proceeds, made by the organization, will go towards the cause for<br>which it exists, to decrease the stray animal population in The Bahamas.</i></p>

  <li>Running The Business</li>
<p><i>Every business organization (including non-profit organizations) requires funds<br>to operate. Therefore, the second portion of the money, that D's Animal Shelter<br> makes, will go towards paying for the things which are neccessary to keep the<br>business running (includes water, electricity, employees, research, marketing<br>and other expenses).</i></p>
   <br><br><br><br>
  <li>Helping Other Animal Shelters and Organizations</li>
  <p><i>D's Animal Shelter is not the only Bahamian organization that is dedicated<br>to the protection, preservation and care of animals. There are other non-profit<br>organizations in The Bahamas that exist for the same purpose and rely on<br>donations to operate. So, the third portion of the proceeds will be donated to<br>these organizations to allow them to continue the work they are doing and to<br>help them plan future fundraisers.</i></p>
