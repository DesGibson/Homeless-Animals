    <h1>Homeless Animals in The Bahamas</h1>
        <h3><b><u>Homeless/Stray Animals</u></b></h3>
        <img class="stray" src="https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2018/11/IMG_0626.jpg" alt="Stray Dogs" width="350" height="350">
        <p><i><!--&nbsp &nbsp--> Homeless (or stray) animals are animals that have been abandoned and neglected. They are either,<br>given up by their owners, or found by animal control, rescued and put into shelters. However, there<br>are few animal shelters in The Bahamas, and many stray animals are still wandering about the<br>streets in the islands of The Bahamas. While there are many national parks in The Bahamas, these<br> mostly cater to threatened and endangered species. Therefore, not much effort is put into finding,<br>rescuing and rehabilitating more common animals such as cats and dogs.</i></p>
        <h3><b><u>How Many are There?</u></b></h3>
        <p><i>When it comes to dogs and cats, Nassau is much like other cities, hundreds of strays on the streets and disease occurs. Homeless animals outnumber homeless people 5 to 1. According to The Bahamas<br>Advocates for Animal Rights group, there are 2,000 unowned dogs and hundreds of stray cats in New Providence. However, after <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-help-stray-dogs-in-the-bahamas-after-hurricane-dorian-18720898" target="_blank">Hurricane Dorian</a>, these numbers increased greatly as many homes were destroyed and the people who these animals depended on tragically died. Now there are more<br>stray/homeless animals than ever before.</i></p>

        <h3><b><u>What is Being Done to Alleviate this Problem?</u></b></h3>
        <p><i>As mentioned before, there are organizations in The Bahamas, such as <a href="https://bnt.bs/" target="_blank">The Bahamas National Trust</a>,<br><a href="https://www.bahamashumane.org/" target="_blank">The Bahamas Humane Society</a> and other animal control services which are dedicated to rescuing,<br>recuperating and rehabilitating animls in need. The following videos show the different types of<br>activities which take place within these organizations in order to decrease the number of homeless<br>animals in The Bahamas.</i></p>
